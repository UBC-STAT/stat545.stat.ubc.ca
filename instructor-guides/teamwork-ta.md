# Teamwork Contract 2020: TA's

Let's use this document to write down some guidelines for how the 2020 teaching team should work together.

Let's also use the following **levels of authority** for teaching assistants:

1\. Vincenzo provides instructions for a TA; TA should feel free to offer suggestions for changing the instructions if they see fit.
2\. TA works independently; but must get the final OK from Vincenzo. 
3\. TA works independently; but must get the final OK from all other members of the teaching team.
4\. TA works independently; but must get the final OK from one other member of the teaching team.
5\. TA works independently (no need to inform other teammates)

(I got the idea of "level of authority" from [Michael Hyatt & co](https://michaelhyatt.com/the-five-levels-of-delegation/) -- generally, higher numbers mean TA's have more authority).

### General Roles

Roles specific to Vincenzo: 

- lead the teaching team and the course as a whole.
- producing video lectures: scripts, filming, and screencasts.

Roles specific to teaching assistants:

| Task | Level of authority |
|------|--------------------|
| Providing feedback and grades on student deliverables | 3 |
| Attend office hours | 5 |


Shared roles:

| Task | Level of authority |
|------|--------------------|
| Administrative tasks (like handling special cases for some students' assignments; we'll rotate these) | 5 |
| Updating the website with existing content | 5 | 
| Staying in touch with the students through our communication channels. | 5 |
| Developing material for the course | 4 |
| Update a week's guidance page | 4 (should be reviewed by the person giving the lectures that week) |
| Updating this teamwork document | 3 | 
| Lecture demonstrations, if a TA chooses to take part in this (first 30 minutes) | 2 |

### Which branch to work on?

**Separate Branch**:

Work on a branch and submit a pull request whenever proposing "big changes", like developing new content for the course.

Rule of thumb for who reviews a pull request: the person who was the primary author on the previous document.

Examples:

- making a new worksheet; 
- making a new assignment; 
- writing a new tutorial; 
- writing a new week guidance page.
- proposing a change to this teamwork document
    - (Doesn't necessarily need a branch -- for example, can commit to master if we've come to a decision during a meeting or in a GitHub Issue, or even Slack)

**Master Branch**:

Work on the master branch for quick fixes or updates to existing structure. These don't need review. Everyone should feel free to take charge of the website.

### Task management

- All tasks are listed on Asana.
- We discuss who will do what for the week on our Monday meeting.
    - Ideally, we'll get into a rhythm where we'll be able to figure out who does what in general.
- TA's shouldn't work more than 12 hours per week on average. Vincenzo will try his best to keep an eye on everyone's tasks to make sure they have an appropriate workload, but each TA should let Vincenzo know whenever their workload is inappropriate (no hard feelings here -- it's important that everyone feel empowered by their roles, not defeated).
- Presence of teaching team members at meetings, lectures, or office hours will be indicated through google calendar invitations.

### Communication

- We'll use the STAT 545 Slack for conversational, everyday communication.
- Use GitHub Issues on the main STAT 545 repo (ubc-stat/stat545.stat.ubc.ca) for discussions that deserve more permanance than Slack.
- We'll meet weekly via Zoom to discuss how we can move forward as a team into a new week.
