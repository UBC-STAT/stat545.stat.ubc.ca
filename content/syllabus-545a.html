<!-- __Non COVID-19 years__: Keep things similar, except synchronous part to be held in-person. -->
<!-- - Lecture done in-person, but with the same structure.  -->
<!--     - Live demo: Still use chat (Slack) so that students can ask questions if they don't want to speak up; still use TA to moderate these. -->
<!--     - Lab part: allow breakout groups to happen just by people's physical presence; 2 teaching team members check in person-by-person, while one keeps watch for hands. -->

<div id="auditing-students" class="section level1">
<h1>Auditing Students</h1>
<p>Auditing students are expected to complete all assessments (i.e. the
deliverables above). The difference between enrolling for credit is that
auditing students are graded on each assessment on a pass/fail basis.</p>
</div>
<div id="privacy" class="section level1">
<h1>Privacy</h1>
<div id="slack" class="section level2">
<h2>Slack</h2>
<p>STAT 545 uses Slack for course communications. Note that the messages
sent on Slack are stored on servers outside of Canada.</p>
</div>
<div id="github.com" class="section level2">
<h2>GitHub.com</h2>
<p>STAT 545 asks students to work on github.com. Please produce work
knowing that the material you put on GitHub will be stored on servers
outside of Canada.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="policies" class="section level1">
<h1>Policies</h1>
<p>In addition to <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/?tree=3,0,0,0">UBC’s Campus-wide Policies and
Regulations</a>, STAT
545A and STAT 545B adopt the following policies.</p>
<div id="communications" class="section level2">
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>Official course communications will occur on the <code>#announcements</code>
channel in Slack. You can expect to receive an invitation to the Slack
workspace by email, but if you haven’t received this, please let the
instructor know.</p>
<p>The teaching team can’t guarantee that they will be able to respond to
student messages outside of typical workday hours (0900-1700 PT). So,
please be mindful of a <strong>17:00 PT cutoff on Fridays</strong> when asking
course related questions.</p>
<p>Please read <a href="/slack_communication">this</a> before messaging the teaching
team.</p>
</div>
<div id="late-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p>A late submission is defined as any work submitted
after the deadline. For a late submission, the student will receive a
warning for the first occurrence, and will receive a
grade of 0 for subsequent occurrences.</p>
</div>
<div id="academic-concession" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Concession</h2>
<p>UBC no longer requires a doctor’s note (or supporting documentation) for
<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0">academic
concession</a>.
A self-declaration will suffice – <a href="/concession_template.pdf">here</a> is a
template you can use. Please submit this to the instructor.</p>
<p>Examples of “conflicting responsibility” are conference travel and time-sensitive field work.</p>
<p>If you arrange to have an assignment submitted late, you may not be able to receive feedback from your peers.</p>
</div>
<div id="plagiarism" class="section level2">
<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Plagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual
submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or
her own and can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple students submitting the same response</li>
<li>copying from sources without citing them</li>
<li>copying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing
to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be
used only rarely, if at all)</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are responsible for ensuring that
any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in
any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their
instructor before handing in any assignments.</p>
<p>For more information see the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959">UBC Academic Misconduct
policies</a>.</p>
<div id="code-plagiarism" class="section level3">
<h3>Code Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Students must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone
else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code
plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal
reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)</li>
<li>the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to
another</li>
<li>the generation of code by automatic code-generations software</li>
</ul>
<p>An “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the
(parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source
code that has been reused.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ubcs-policies-and-resources-to-support-student-success" class="section level2">
<h2>UBC’s Policies and Resources to Support Student Success</h2>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain
healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so
there are additional resources to access including those for survivors
of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all
members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not
tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides
appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for
religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic
honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by
others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their
actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available
<a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-personal-health" class="section level2">
<h2>Your personal health</h2>
<p>If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated
against COVID-19 or the flu, vaccines are available to you, free, and on campus. The higher the rate of
vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading disease. You are an important part of the UBC community. Please
arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what
you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other).</strong> Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. The structure of this class is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>If you do miss class because of illness:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consult the class resources on the course website,
<a href="https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/" class="uri">https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/</a>.</li>
<li>Come to office hours on Zoom.</li>
<li>Use Slack to carry out discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional information about academic concessions, see the UBC
policy here:
<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0" class="uri">http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0</a></p>
</div>
<div id="instructor-health" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructor health</h2>
<p><strong>If I (the instructor) am sick:</strong> If I am ill, then I will not come to class. If that
happens, here’s what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I am well enough to teach, I will conduct virtual lectures
through Zoom until I am well. If this happens, you will be tagged in
an announcement via Slack with information. You can anticipate that
this would very likely be a last minute announcement. Our classroom
will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session,
although it is recommended that you bring headphones.</li>
<li>If I am not well enough to teach, it is possible that one or more
teaching assistants will take my place. But if not, we will either
try to make up for lost time, make new resources to aid in your
learning, or make accommodations regarding the assignments.</li>
</ul>
