<!-- ******TUESDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Tuesday's Class `r tues_class_num`: Collaboration with git and GitHub

```{r tues-date}
cat(tues_date_pretty)
```

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Recognize the main use of github as a cloud storage and collaboration tool
- Create a github account and repo
- Navigate their set up repo and perform basic collaborative tasks such as:
  + Branching
  + Opening issues and contributing to issues
  + Opening and merging a pull request
  + Navigating the commit history of a file and repository
- Edit plain text files on GitHub.
- Identify the basic workflow used in git collaboration



#### Prepare for Class

+ No lecture worksheet *per se* today (there will be a document to include instructions to these  activities), the following should be completed:
 - A github account
 - **Delivarable**: A link to your personal GitHub repo 
 
+ The idea with the prework is that it covers, in 30 minutes max, setting a GitHub account and using GitHub as cloud storage - then the class time can be used for setting up Git and the use of GitHub for collaboration

  + Adapting the material in [Topic 2: GitHub](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/introduction-to-stat-545-and-github.html#topic-2-github-35-min) into a document that students can follow through, but only until (and including) "1.5.3 GitHub as cloud storage - Activity". I think that the rest is easier to just do in class (setting up Git, etc) than having them look through the STAT545 repo, which I find can be a bit confusing.

- Watch the STAT 545 Video Series: Class `r tues_class_num`

**Optional Reading**

[Wysiwyg is dead](https://medium.com/@ayman/wysiwyg-is-dead-d225276ed53)
- An entertaining and concise argument against using "WYSIWYG" editors like Microsoft Word.


#### During Class

+ Configure Git-overview and demo (~15 min)
  + Demo [the typical workflow](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/the-version-control-workflow.html#the-typical-workflow-8-min) (~8 min)
  + Students follow [the typical workflow activity](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/the-version-control-workflow.html#the-typical-workflow-activity-5-min) in the repo that they created as pre-work (~5-6 min)
  + **2 minute break**
+ GitHub for collaboration (~30 min):
  + Giving group partners the chance to interact in a breakout room, introduce themselves & create a group repository and do the following (20 min):
    + Branching
    + Opening issues and features 
    + Open and merge a pull request
    + Merge conflicts
+ Go over this activity and  & intro to the [collaborative troubleshooting assignment](LINK TO TEAM TROUBLE SHOOTING) (10 min)
+ Worksheet 1A Section 1A : A first glance at R world demo (30 min)
