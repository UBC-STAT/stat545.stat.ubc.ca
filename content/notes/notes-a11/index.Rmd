From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Recognize how to manipulate data through a variety of tibble joins such as:
    + Mutating joins: `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, `anti_join()`
    + Filtering joins: `semi_join()`, `anti_join()`
- Perform binding: `bind_rows()`, `bind_cols()`
- Join more than 2 tibbles
- Join based on multiple conditions
- Perform set operations on data: `intersect()`, `union()`, `setdiff()`
- Join tibbles with different types of variables

## Overview of join functions

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(gsheet)
```

**Note:** In order to merge two tibbles, you need to have an identifier variable that has unique values for every row of observations in both tibbles.

Create two sample tibbles:

```{r}
# First tibble
df1 <- tibble(ID = 1:3,                     
              Name = c("Sophie", "Josh","Alex"))

# Second tibble
df2 <- tibble(ID = 2:4,                      
              Age = c(20,50,31))
```

![](images/df.png){#id .class width=50% height=50%}


## Mutating joins

### Join matching rows from df2 to df1

![](images/left_join.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

```{r}
left_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

### Join matching rows from df1 to df2

![](images/right_join.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

```{r}
right_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

### Retain only rows present in both sets

![](images/inner_join.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}
 
```{r}
inner_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```


### Retain all values, all rows

![](images/full_join.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

```{r}
full_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

## Filtering joins

### Retain all rows in df1 that have a match in df2

![](images/semi_join.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

```{r}
semi_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```

### Retain all rows in df1 that do not have a match in df2

![](images/anti_join.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

```{r}
anti_join(df1, df2, by = "ID")
```


## Binding

### Append df2 to df1 as new rows

![](images/bind_rows.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

```{r}
bind_rows(df1, df2)
```

### Append df2 to df1 as new columns

![](images/bind_cols.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

```{r}
bind_cols(df1, df2)
```


## Joining multiple (>2) tibbles

Create a third tibble
```{r}
df3 <- tibble(ID = 1:5,                      
              Height = c(175,167,190,155,160))
```

![](images/three_tibbles.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}


Use piping operator (%>%) to layer multiple join functions
```{r}
full_join(df1, df2, by = "ID") %>%
  full_join(df3, by = "ID") 
```


## Joining tibbles on multiple conditions

![](images/new_df.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

Create two new tibbles df4 and df5

```{r}
df4 <- tibble(FirstName = c("Sophie", "Josh","Alex"),
              LastName=c("Wang","Smith","Smith"),
              Age = c(42,20,50))

df5 <- tibble(First_name = c("Josh","Alex","Sophie"),        
              Last_name=c("Smith","Smith","Jones"),
              Height = c(167,190,155))
```


![](images/multiple_conditions.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

```{r}
full_join(df4, df5, by = c("FirstName" = "First_name", "LastName" = "Last_name"))
```


<!-- What if you did not realize that multiple people shared the same Last Name? -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- full_join(df4, df5, by = c("LastName" = "Last_name")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What if you did not realize that multiple people shared the same First Name? -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- full_join(df4, df5, by = c("FirstName" = "First_name")) -->
<!-- ``` -->


## Set operations

Create sample tibbles

![](images/new_df2.png){#id .class width=50% height=50%}

```{r}
# First tibble
df6 <- tibble(Number = 1:3,                     
              Letter = c("A", "B","C"))

# Second tibble
df7 <- tibble(Number = 2:4,                      
              Letter = c("B","C","D"))
```


### Include rows that appear in both tibbles

![](images/intersect.png){#id .class width=60% height=60%}

```{r}
intersect(df6, df7)
```

### Include rows that appear in either or both tibbles

![](images/union.png){#id .class width=60% height=60%}

```{r}
union(df6, df7)
```

### Include rows that appear in one df but not another

![](images/setdiff.png){#id .class width=60% height=60%}

Include rows that appear in df6 but not in df7
```{r}
setdiff(df6, df7)
```

Include rows that appear in df7 but not in df6
```{r}
setdiff(df7, df6)
```


## Joining tibbles with different types of variables

You can also join tibbles with sets of predictions:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(5)
model1 <- tibble(x = x, yhat = 2.1 + 3.2 * x)
model2 <- tibble(x = x, yhat = 1.5 + 2.9 * x)
left_join(model1, model2, by = "x")
```

## Your turn: learning tibble joins 

We think the best way to learn the basics of tibble joins from here is to work through the corresponding part of Worksheet A5. 

There will be some class time to go over solutions if you got stuck on any questions. 

<!-- If we have time, then we will do a case study with the `gapminder` data. [Link to case study here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/notes/supp-a11.Rmd).  -->
