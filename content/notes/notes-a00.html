<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To install and setup key software for use in the course. Instructions are below.</p>
<p><strong>IF YOU NEED EXTRA HELP</strong>: TAs are available from 9am-10:30am in Mathematics Annex 1100 on Tuesday September 5th.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-1-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1: R and RStudio</h2>
<p>The main programming language used in the class is R and our main IDE (a text editor with helpful features for writing and running code) is RStudio.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html">Chapter 5</a> of Jenny Bryan’s “happy git” book to install R and RStudio if you haven’t already.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have R and/or RStudio but haven’t updated them in a long time – e.g. a year or more – then we recommend that you take the time to update them now. This will make it easier for us to help you troubleshoot throughout the class.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="step-2-jupyter-and-r-kernel" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2: Jupyter and R Kernel</h2>
<p>You will need another IDE for R (Jupyter Notebook) and an R kernel called ‘IR Kernel’ (needed to run R code within Jupyter) to work on the autograded worksheets. This is because the autograder we use plays well with Jupyter.</p>
<p>The following instructions are adapted from <a href="https://richpauloo.github.io/2018-05-16-Installing-the-R-kernel-in-Jupyter-Lab/">Rich Pauloo</a>.</p>
<div id="for-pc" class="section level3">
<h3>For PC</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Install Anaconda from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">here</a>. This gives you Jupyter and the Anaconda Prompt command line tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Install and setup the IR Kernel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the location of <code>R.exe</code> on your computer. (The location probably looks something like <code>C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.1\bin</code>.)</li>
<li>Open the Anaconda Prompt application. Enter the following command into Anaconda Prompt: <code>cd file_path_here</code>, with <code>file_path_here</code> replaced with the location of <code>R.exe</code> that you previously found.</li>
<li>Run R from within Anaconda Prompt by entering in <code>R.exe</code>. This opens an R session inside Anaconda Prompt. From here, enter the following commands in sequence: <code>install.packages("IRkernel")</code> and <code>IRkernel::installspec()</code>. This respectively installs IR Kernel and tells Jupyter where to find IR Kernel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To verify that everything is working as intended: Open Anaconda Prompt and type in <code>jupyter lab</code>. Jupyter Lab should launch and display both a Python and R kernel.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="for-osx" class="section level3">
<h3>For OSX:</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Install Anaconda from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">here</a>. This gives you Jupyter.</p></li>
<li><p>Install and setup the IR Kernel.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Open up the Terminal application. Run R from within Terminal by entering in <code>R</code>. This opens an R session inside Terminal. From here, enter the following commands in sequence: <code>install.packages("IRkernel")</code> and <code>IRkernel::installspec()</code>. This respectively installs IR Kernel and tells Jupyter where to find IR Kernel.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To verify that everything is working as intended: Open Jupyter Lab (e.g. by opening up the Anacaonda Navigator application and clicking Launch inside the JupyterLab box). Jupyter Lab should launch and display both a Python and R kernel.</li>
</ol>

<div id="step-3-git-and-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3: Git and Github</h2>
<p>Git is a version control software. Github is a cloud-based platform (built on Git) for sharing code.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Register a Github account at github.com. See <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html">Chapter 4</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install git. <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure git. See <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html">Chapter 7: Introduce yourself to git</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Get setup with a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT): this will allow you to sync GitHub with files on your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Step 1:</u> Create a PAT</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Option 1: Go to to <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens" class="uri">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a> and click “Generate token”. Describe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “vm-for-project-xyz”. Select “repo”, “user”, and “workflow” for scopes.</p></li>
<li><p>Option 2: From R, execute <code>usethis::create_github_token()</code> (you may have to install the usethis package first by first running <code>install.packages("usethis")</code>). Describe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “vm-for-project-xyz”.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Step 2:</u> From R, execute `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` and enter the PAT that you just made when prompted. (You may have to install the gitcreds package first by first running <code>install.packages("gitcreds")</code>). That should be it!</p></li>
<li><p><u>Step 3</u> (<strong>optional but recommended</strong>) Also save the PAT that you just made somewhere secure, like a password manager.</p></li>
</ul></li>
