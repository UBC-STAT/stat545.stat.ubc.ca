## Motor Trend Car Road Tests data

The Motor Trend Car Road Tests (`mtcars`) data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

For now, we need to remove three erroneous data points: the Mazda RX4, the Valiant, and the Volvo 142E.

We print out the data below. 

```{r}
mtcars
```

## Number of gears vs. transmission 

Let's find out how many cars have different numbers of gears. 

```{r}
table(mtcars$gear)
```

Now let's explore the relationship between the number of gears and transmission. 

```{r} 
table(mtcars$am, mtcars$gear)
```

We see that no automatic cars have 5 gears, and no manual cars have 3 gears. 

## Horsepower vs. Mileage

Let's find out if there's a relationship between car horsepower vs. mileage. 

```{r} 
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```
