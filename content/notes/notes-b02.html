<p>From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to build a basic R package, especially using the <code>devtools</code> package.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a DESCRIPTION file</li>
<li>Carefully curate package dependencies</li>
<li>Document functions and data using roxygen2 comments and tags</li>
<li>Include tests with testthat in accordance with the R package infrastructure.</li>
<li>Add a license</li>
<li>Update an R package via semantic versioning, NEWS, changelog.</li>
<li>Develop and build informative vignettes and a package README.</li>
</ul>
<!--
- Add a code of conduct
-->
<!--
And possibly:

- Make a package website with pkgdown.
- Make a code coverage report and page with covr.
- Add badges to the README.
- Build an S3 object oriented package
-->

<h2>Why R Packages</h2>
<p>Why make an R package? As mentioned in the “functions” topic, your analysis will probably benefit from homemade functions: making functions forces you to think about your analysis in terms of its key computational parts, and makes for robust and readable code. Here are a few benefits that result by bundling these functions into an R package:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily access function documentation</li>
<li>Easy to share</li>
<li>Built-in checks to ensure your package is working</li>
<li>Provides a template for organizing your work</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternative is keeping the functions stored in separate files, and <code>source()</code>ing them into your analysis scripts, but this can become unwieldy.</p>
<p>Plus, if your package becomes <em>really</em> nice, you might want to share it with the world! At least one tidyverse package supposedly has origins in code that Hadley Wickham bundled up during his PhD.</p>
<p>Finally, packages are a nice way to share datasets – think about the <code>gapminder</code> package or the <code>palmerpenguins</code> package.</p>

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>For this topic, we’ll be making an R package like the toy <a href="https://github.com/lucylgao/square">square package</a>, by following along with <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html">“The Whole Game” Chapter of “R packages”</a>. Here’s a checklist based on that chapter. If you miss class, then try following along using the book, and coming to office hours or asking questions on Slack if you get stuck.</p>
<p>First, make a minimal viable product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the <code>devtools</code> package in the console (do this every time you go to work on your package).</li>
<li>Run <code>create_package()</code> in the console (all devtools functions should be written in the console).
<ul>
<li>Better defaults than going through the File menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>use_git()</code>
<ul>
<li>Prefer to start your project on GitHub? Or locally? Either way, useful instructions for what to do can be found <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/usage-intro.html">in “Happy Git with R” Part III</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make a new R script using <code>use_r()</code>, and write a function there: start with <code>square()</code>. It should take in a single argument and square it.</li>
<li>Test drive after using <code>load_all()</code>.</li>
<li>Check that the package is intact: run <code>check()</code>.</li>
<li>Edit the DESCRIPTION file. For the license, <code>use_mit_license("Your Name")</code>.</li>
<li>Document the function: “Code &gt; Insert roxygen skeleton”, then run <code>document()</code>.</li>
<li>Install and Restart, or run <code>install()</code>. Try loading the package and using it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, expand:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>use_testthat()</code> for your package, and make an R script containing tests
<ul>
<li>Check all tests with <code>test()</code>. This also happens with <code>check()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We don’t really need to use functions from another package here, but practice declaring your general intention to use some functions from the dplyr namespace with <code>use_package("dplyr")</code>.</li>
<li>Connect your local package to Github with <code>use_github()</code>.</li>
<li>Add a package README with <code>use_readme_rmd()</code>, and render it every time with <code>build_readme()</code>.
<ul>
<li>Once you successfully sync your package to GitHub, other people can install the package with <code>devtools::install_github("your_username/package_name")</code> – this should go in the README.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make a vignette with <code>use_vignette()</code>. Build all vignettes with <code>build_vignettes()</code>.</li>
<li>Include data with the R package with <code>use_data(R_OBJECT_HERE)</code>. Then document <em>a string of its name</em> in a new R script using <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data">a different collection of roxygen tags</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Release your package:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a NEWS.md file with <code>use_news_md()</code> and add the main development notes.<br />
</li>
<li>Choose a version number; put in description file, and tag a release on GitHub.
<ul>
<li>You should also prepare your package for the next version – I suggest doing this on a new branch.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="test-your-understanding" class="section level2">
<h2>Test Your Understanding</h2>
<p>It might help to browse a completed package directory to answer these questions, like the <a href="https://github.com/vincenzocoia/powers">powers package</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>True or False: The mandatory files in an R package are a DESCRIPTION file, a NAMESPACE file, and functions in the R/ directory – everything else is just helpful.</li>
<li>So far we’ve been using devtools functions in the console (instead of saved in a script). True or False: if you’re making a bigger R package, you should start putting those devtools functions in one or more R scripts.</li>
<li>True or False: Add any package name to the <code>Imports</code> field in the DESCRIPTION file, and we can now use functions from that package using <code>::</code>.</li>
<li>True or False: We can’t <em>both</em> add exports to the NAMESPACE file manually and by using <code>devtools::document()</code>.</li>
</ol>
