title: "Reading and Writing Data"

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Read and write a delimited file, like a csv, from R using the `readr` package.
- Make relative paths using the `here::here()` function.
- Read data from a spreadsheet
- Read and write R binary files (rds files) from R.


## Resources

Video lecture:

- [Reading and Writing Data](https://youtu.be/2nHuNu6Zaqk)

Tutorial:

- The ["Writing and Reading files"](https://stat545.com/import-export.html) chapter of stat545.com.

## Test your Understanding

1. True or False: if you want to be deliberate about where `here::here()` points to on your computer, you need to ensure you have an .Rproj file.
2. True or False: Suppose you have an .Rproj file in the same folder as your R script. Running `here::here()` from that R script will always point to that folder.

## Main Idea behind `here::here()`

Up until now, we always wrote and read files to our current directory. If we wanted to use a different folder on our computer, we could specify something like: 

- `Documents/STAT545/exported_file.csv` - Mac uses forward slashes
- `Documents\STAT545\exported_file.csv` - Windows uses backward slashes

However, if you wanted to make your Rproj more portable and accessible to more users in a cross-platform (between Mac, Unix, Windows users), rather than specifying every path explicitly, `here::here()` allows you to set relative paths much more easily.

We won't elaborate here. For a tutorial, read the above noted STAT 545 chapter on ["Writing and Reading files"](https://stat545.com/import-export.html). 

## Your turn: learning to read and write data

We think the best way to learn the basics of reading and writing data is to work through Worksheet A6.  

There will be some class time to go over solutions if you got stuck on any questions.
