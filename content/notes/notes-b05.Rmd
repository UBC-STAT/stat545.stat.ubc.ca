From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Manipulate a character vector in R using the stringr package.
- Write simple regular expressions (regex).
- Apply stringr and regular expressions to manipulate data in tibbles.

## Resources

Video lecture:

- [Regular Expressions and stringr for Text Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0dJ1zpxAtU) (only labelled as "age restricted" because it looks at real emails within the Enron company.)

Written material:

- Overview tutorials similar to our worksheet:
    - [stat545.com Chapter 11: character vectors](https://stat545.com/character-vectors.html)
    - [R4DS Chapter 14: strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html).
- The stat545.com Chapter 11 on character vectors [has an elaborate discussion on useful resources](https://stat545.com/character-vectors.html#resources-3) for learning more about strings. 

## Test Your Understanding

Use these questions to check your understanding of the material.

1. True or False: The regular expression `[ab][ab]` will match "ab", "aa", and "bb" as possibilities, whereas `[ab]{2}` will only match "aa" or "bb".
2. True or False: The regular expression `[ab][ab]` will match "ab", "aa", and "bb" as possibilities, whereas `(ab)(ab)` will only match "aa" or "bb".
3. True or False: The regular expression `^ab` will match "ab" as the first characters to a string, whereas `[^ab]` will match "a" or "b" as being the first character to a string.

## Demonstration

__Note that re*g*ex is different from re*pr*ex!__ They sound the same, but are very different things:

- re*pr*ex = reproducible example.
- re*g*ex = regular expression.

reprex:

```
reprex::reprex({
    x <- 5
    x * 2
})
#> Rendering reprex...
#> Rendered reprex is on the clipboard.
```

regex:

```
"STAT 545[A|B].*"
```
