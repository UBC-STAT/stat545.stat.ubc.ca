<p>From today’s class, students are anticipated to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read and write a delimited file, like a csv, from R using the <code>readr</code> package.</li>
<li>Make relative paths using the <code>here::here()</code> function.</li>
<li>Read data from a spreadsheet</li>
<li>Read and write R binary files (rds files) from R.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test your Understanding</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>True or False: if you want to be deliberate about where <code>here::here()</code> points to on your computer, you need to ensure you have an .Rproj file.</li>
<li>True or False: Suppose you have an .Rproj file in the same folder as your R script. Running <code>here::here()</code> from that R script will always point to that folder.</li>
</ol>

<div id="main-idea-behind-herehere" class="section level2">
<h2>Main Idea behind <code>here::here()</code></h2>
<p>Up until now, we always wrote and read files to our current directory. If we wanted to use a different folder on our computer, we could specify something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Documents/STAT545/exported_file.csv</code> - Mac uses forward slashes</li>
<li><code>Documents\STAT545\exported_file.csv</code> - Windows uses backward slashes</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you wanted to make your Rproj more portable and accessible to more users in a cross-platform (between Mac, Unix, Windows users), rather than specifying every path explicitly, <code>here::here()</code> allows you to set relative paths much more easily.</p>
<p>We won’t elaborate here. For a tutorial, read the above noted STAT 545 chapter on <a href="https://stat545.com/import-export.html">“Writing and Reading files”</a>.</p>

<h2>Your turn: learning to read and write data</h2>
<p>We think the best way to learn the basics of reading and writing data is to work through Worksheet A6.</p>
<p>There will be some class time to go over solutions if you got stuck on any questions.</p>
