## Learning Objectives 

From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to:

-   recognize whether a given dataset is 'tidy' or 'untidy'
-   understand why 'tidy' data is useful
-   reshape a dataset between a 'long' and 'wide' format, using `tidyr::pivot_longer()` and `tidyr::pivot_wider()`
-   deal with missing data in a tibble

## Resources

Video lecture for this topic:

-   [tidyr for Pivoting and Tidy Data](https://youtu.be/qivE6exNsZI)

Written resources on tidy data:

-   To learn how to use the `pivot_*()` functions, consult tidyr's [pivot vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).

-   To get a better understanding of the concept of tidy data:

    -   Hadley Wickham's [paper on Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) is the gold standard treatment of tidy data.
    -   A "code heavy" version of the tidy data paper is tidyr's ["Tidy Data" vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).

## Tidy Data and the Tidyverse 

In the last two weeks, we learned about the `dplyr` package for data manipulation and the `ggplot2` package for graphing. These two packages are part of the "tidyverse": a collection of data science packages that are designed to have input data frames and output data frames that are *tidy*. In fact, we can load all packages in the tidyverse at once with the single command `library(tidyverse)`. 

Here, we are using the word "tidy" in a technical sense - we're not talking about how "neat" or "organized" your data is. Instead, "tidy" is a very specific set of rules for storing data.

## Your turn: work with some untidy data 

All of the data we used before this week were already tidy. This made it easy to use the tidyverse packages `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to do what we needed to do. What happens when that's not the case? 

The `fivethirtyeight` R package contains a dataset called `drinks`. This dataset was compiled as part of a [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) that explored (among other things) which countries consumes the most alcohol.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight)

drinks_tbl1 <- as_tibble(drinks)
head(drinks_tbl1)
```

The following graphic was made from the `drinks` dataset.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
drinks_tbl2 <- drinks_tbl1 %>% select(!total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) %>% pivot_longer(cols=ends_with("_servings"), names_to = "Alcohol", names_pattern = "(.*)_servings", values_to="Servings") %>% 
mutate(Alcohol=str_to_title(Alcohol))

drinks_tbl2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=Servings)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(vars(Alcohol)) + ylab("Number of countries in each alcohol consumption group") + 
  xlab("Number of servings of alcohol consumed in 2010")
```

With a partner or a small group: 

1. Is it possible to reproduce the plots above using `drinks_tbl1` and *only* the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages? 
2. What is tidy format here? Mentally (or with pen and paper, or even with a spreadsheet editor like Excel or Google Sheets) sketch out the format of the tidy tibble. 
3. How would you reproduce the plots above using the `ggplot2` packages, given the data set in tidy format? 
4. Does it take a lot of code and effort to carry out the reproduction? 

Too easy? Then discuss the steps for how you would transform the first few rows of `drinks_tbl1` from untidy to tidy "by hand", i.e. not by using the tools from the `tidyr` package that we will learn about this week.

## Tidy depends on the data analysis plan 

> "You better think (think) about what you're trying to do ..." - Aretha Franklin, "Think"

It's clear from the definition that tidiness is an attribute of a dataset. But did you know that tidiness also depends on what you are planning to *do* with the data? That's because what's an observation and what's a variable depends on the data analysis plan! 

We will demonstrate using data from "The Great British Bake Off" compiled by [Allison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/) in the R package `bakeoff`. The graphics that follow (and the code to produce the graphics) were lightly adapted from Allison's [Plot Twist talk](https://www.apreshill.com/talk/2019-rladies-sydney/). 

Here is a bar plot of the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window per episode, coloured by series.

```{r} 
library(bakeoff)

ratings_tbl1 <- ratings %>% 
  mutate(ep_id = row_number()) %>% 
  select(ep_id, viewers_7day, series, episode) 

# create coordinates for labels
series_labels <- ratings_tbl1 %>% 
  mutate(series=as.factor(series)) %>% 
  group_by(series) %>% 
  summarize(y_position = median(viewers_7day) + 1,
            x_position = mean(ep_id))

# make the plot
ratings_tbl1 %>% mutate(series=as.factor(series)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = ep_id, y = viewers_7day, fill = series)) +
  geom_col(alpha = .9) + 
  ggtitle("7-Day Viewership across Series 1-10") +
  geom_text(data = series_labels, aes(label = series,
                                      x = x_position, 
                                      y = y_position)) +
  theme_classic() +  
  scale_fill_manual(values = bakeoff_palette(), 
                    guide = "none") +
  xlab("Episode Number") + 
  ylab("7-Day Viewership (millions)")
```

This bar plot was constructed with the following tidy data representation:

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
head(ratings_tbl1)
```

Every row is an observation (a unique episode), and the columns are variables (episode number across series, 7-day viewership, series, and episode number within series).

### Your turn: what's tidy for a different plot? 

Here is another bar plot displaying percentage increase in the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window from the premiere episode to finale episode for the first 10 series, based on the tidy tibble `ratings_tbl2`. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ratings_tbl2 <- ratings_tbl1 %>% mutate(series=as.factor(series)) %>% 
  group_by(series) %>% filter(episode == 1 | episode == max(episode)) %>% ungroup() %>% mutate(episode = recode(episode, `1` = "first", .default = "last")) %>% pivot_wider(id_cols=series, names_from=episode, values_from=viewers_7day)
```

```{r} 
ratings_tbl2 %>% mutate(pct_change = (last - first)/first) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(series), y=pct_change)) + 
  geom_col(fill = bakeoff::bakeoff_colors("baltic"), alpha = .5) + 
  labs(x = "Series", y = "% Increase in Viewers, First to Last Episode") +
  ggtitle("% Increase in Viewers from Premiere to Finale") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_classic() + 
  coord_flip() 
```

With a partner or a small group: 

1. What do you think `ratings_tbl2` looks like? 
2. Why is it tidy? 
3. Could you have calculated the information in `ratings_tbl2` using `ratings_tbl1`? (No need to write code - just discuss whether it's possible.) 

## Pivoting for Tidying

The `tidyr` package is loaded with the `tidyverse` and provides functions for pivoting data.  It has two main "pivoting" type functions: 

1. `pivot_longer()` makes datasets *longer*: it moves some information in the columns into new rows, thereby *increasing* the number of *rows* of the dataset.  
2.  `pivot_wider()` makes datasets *wider*: it moves some information in the rows into new columns, thereby *decreasing* the number of rows of the dataset. 
By now, you should have a sense for why this might be useful for tidying! 

### Pivoting Wider

Here is some code to create a variable for whether an episode is the first or last episode of the season to `ratings_tbl1` and subset to only the data from the first and last episodes of each eason. 

```{r} 
ratings_tbl1 <- ratings_tbl1 %>% 
 group_by(series) %>% 
  filter(episode == 1 | episode == max(episode)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(episode_fl = recode(episode, `1` = "first", .default = "last"))

head(ratings_tbl1)
```

This is not the same format as `ratings_tbl2`. But it does contain the same information. To convert `ratings_tbl1` into `ratings_tbl2`, we need to make `ratings_tbl1` *wider*: we need to move some information in the rows (the info about whether each episode is the first or last episode of each season) into new columns. 

We can solve this problem using `pivot_wider`, which needs three pieces of information. 

- What is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each observation? Put their names in the `id_cols` argument. 

-  Where should the names for the new columns come from? Put the name of the column you want to take the new variable names from in the `names_from` argument. 

- What values should the new columns contain? Put the name of the  columns you want to take the values from to `values_from` in the `values_from` argument. 

Note that if you don't specify an `id_cols` argument, `pivot_wider` will assume that you want it to be every column except those in `names_from` and `values_from`. 

```{r} 
ratings_tbl2 <- ratings_tbl1 %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = series, 
              names_from=episode_fl, 
              values_from=viewers_7day)

head(ratings_tbl2)
```

Also note that any columns not included in `id_cols`, `names_from`, and `values_from` (e.g. `ep_id`) will simply be dropped. 

If we wanted to keep the info in `ep_id` as well, we would add it to the `values_from` argument:

```{r}
ratings_tbl1 %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = series, 
              names_from=episode_fl, 
              values_from=c(viewers_7day, ep_id))
```

### Pivoting Longer 

#### The Basics: Column Names Contain Variable Values 

Here is a snippet of WHO data on the number of tuberculosis cases in different years in different countries. 

```{r} 
table4a
```

If we wanted to visualize tuberculosis cases over time by country, then this format is not tidy. We want every column to be a variable, like the year, the case count, and the country name, and every row to be an observation (measurements within a country and a year). 

That is, we need to make `table4a` *longer*: we need to move some information in the column names (the info about the measurement year) into  new rows. 

We can solve this problem using `pivot_longer`, which needs three pieces of information. 

- Which are the columns that we want to expand into more rows? Put their names in the `cols` argument. 

- We want to save the information in the names of those columns as values in new column(s) of our dataset. What should we name these new column(s)? This is the `names_to` argument. 

- We also want to preserve the information in the *values* of those columns - so we should save them as values in a new column of our dataset. What should we name it? This is the `values_to` argument. 

```{r} 
table4a %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(`1999`, `2000`), 
                         names_to = "year", 
                         values_to = "cases")
```

#### Challenge 1: Column Names Contain Multiple Variable Values

Here's a more realistic (but still simplified!!!) look at the WHO Tuberculosis data. 

```{r} 
who_demo <- who2 %>% 
  select(country, year, starts_with("sp")) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) 
    str_remove(x, pattern="sp_"), 
    starts_with("sp")) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1999, 2000)) %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Afghanistan", "Brazil", "China"))

head(who_demo)
```

This time, cases are broken down by gender (`f/m`) and by age range (`014\1524\2534\3544\4554\5564\65`). 

There are five variables in this data set: country, year, gender, age range, and case count. Values for gender and age range are currently located in the column names of `who_demo`, and values for case count are currently spread across multiple columns. So to tidy `who_demo` up, we need to use `pivot_longer()` to move the info in the columns into new rows. 

Conceptually, this is pretty similar to the last example: we want to use the information in `m_014`, `m_1524`, etc.  to create new rows. So we should put those column names into the `cols` argument. But now, we want the information in their column names - the gender and age - to go into *two* new columns: gender and age. We can do this by specifying two column names in the `names_to` argument: `gender` and `age`. 

But how is `pivot_longer()` to know which part of the column name `m_014` corresponds to the gender, and which part corresponds to the age? You need to tell it that the pieces of information are separated by the "_" character using the `names_sep` argument. 

Finally, we can specify the name of the new column we want the values in the `m_014`, `m_1524`, etc. columns to go into with the `values_to` argument. 

```{r}
who_demo %>% pivot_longer(cols = !(country:year),
                          names_to = c("gender", "age"),
                          names_sep = "_",
                          values_to = "cases")
```

#### Challenge 2: Column Names Contain Variable Names And Values 

So far we have seen examples where the column names contain variable values. But what if they contain names AND values? 

Let's have a look at the `household` dataset (loaded with the `tidyr` package), which has the date of birth and names of two children in families. Let's say that we wanted to investigate how children names relate to their date of birth. 


```{r} 
head(household)
```

We'd want "date of birth" and "name" to be two variables associated with an observation (a child). We know we want to use `pivot_longer()`, because we want to make `household` longer by creating new variables. But wait! The names of the "date of birth"/"name" variables AND the values of the "child" variable are BOTH in the column names of `household`! 

Inspecting [the documentation](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) for `pivot_longer()` very carefully reveals that you can use a special specification of the `names_to` argument to resolve this problem. 

```{r} 
household %>% pivot_longer(cols = -family, 
                           names_to = c(".value", "child"), 
                           names_sep = "_")
```

The special `".value"` specification says that we want to use the first component of the pivoted column name as a variable name, and make a new column with values coming from the second component of the pivoted column name. The second thing we pass into `names_to` names that new column. 

This process is best described by [Figure 6.7 from R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy#fig-pivot-names-and-values). 

## Separating and Uniting for Tidying

The `tidyr` package has a function for gluing columns together (`unite`) and for cutting columns apart (`separate`). Why might this help us tidy? Here is another snippet of WHO Tuberculosis data.

```{r} 
table3
```

The `rate` column contains the values of two variables: case counts and population counts. We would like to snip it apart at the "/" character to create two columns: 

```{r} 
(table5 <- table3 %>% separate(col = rate, 
                    into = c("cases", "population")))
```

The `col` argument specifies the column we want to separate, 
and the `into` argument specifies the names of the new columns. The `sep` argument (not specified here) specifies where we want to cut. The default is pretty clever - it separates at any non-alphanumeric value. (How this is accomplished involves *regular expressions*, which are very useful when working with character data. We will learn more about regular expressions in STAT 545B. )

## Your turn: learning to use tidyr

We think the best way to learn the basics of tidyr is to work through the first two parts of Worksheet A4. 

### First 30 minutes of Class 2

- Haven't attempted all of the questions on the first two parts of Worksheet A4? Then spend this time attempting unattempted questions. 
- Finished attempting all of the questions? Then do the optional [R4DS Tidying](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy) reading, and maybe even do some of the exercises for extra practice. 

During this time, teaching team will also walk around and answer questions and chat about anything tidy related. 

### Next 50 min in Class 2

Now's your chance to ask about any questions you got stuck on and get them answered by the instructor! 

## Coda: The Merits of Untidy Data

As we've seen, tidy data is often very helpful. But there are also times when *un*tidy data is good. Here are a few reasons: 

- The format that lends itself best to fast computations might not be tidy. [Case Study: Tidy Genomics](http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/). 
- Untidy data is often easier for humans to interpret and edit. See [Untidy Data: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15005.pdf).
- We lose important information about the data context by tidying. This can have important ethical implications; see Chapter 5 of the book ["Data Feminism"](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein. 

In summary, tidiness is a very useful concept, and tidying data is often useful. But we should remember that absolutes are few and far between in data science and statistics. Just because tidying data is *often* useful, doesn't mean it's *always* useful.
