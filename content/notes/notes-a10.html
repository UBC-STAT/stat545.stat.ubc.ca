<h2>Factors</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no other object that creates as much trouble as factors.” - Patrick Burns, “The R Inferno”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In R, we use <em>factors</em> to represent <em>categorical variables</em>: variables that take on a fixed number of known values (i.e. <em>levels</em>). For example, in the <code>penguins</code> data set, <code>species</code> is a factor with three levels: “Adelie”, “Chinstrap”, and “Gentoo”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glimpse(penguins)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 344
## Columns: 8
## $ species           &lt;fct&gt; Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…
## $ island            &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…
## $ bill_length_mm    &lt;dbl&gt; 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, …
## $ bill_depth_mm     &lt;dbl&gt; 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, …
## $ flipper_length_mm &lt;int&gt; 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…
## $ body_mass_g       &lt;int&gt; 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …
## $ sex               &lt;fct&gt; male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…
## $ year              &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…</code></pre>
<p><strong>Under the hood</strong>, R stores a factor with (say) 3 levels as a numeric vector containing integers between 1 and 3, paired with a character vector of length 3 that identifies the mapping between the numbers 1, 2, and 3 and the levels.</p>
<p>This is not immediately obvious, because R will print factors using the character string levels rather than the numbers that it stores:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>penguins %&gt;% slice_sample(n=10) %&gt;% pull(species)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] Chinstrap Chinstrap Gentoo    Adelie    Chinstrap Chinstrap Adelie   
##  [8] Chinstrap Adelie    Gentoo   
## Levels: Adelie Chinstrap Gentoo</code></pre>
<p>This dual nature of factors creates a whole slew of hidden traps and headaches, especially for new useRs!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, factors are important and worth the pain. Many functions throughout the R landscape expect categorical variables to be coded as factors. For example, when making plots in either <code>ggplot2</code> or in base R, we need factors in order to map categorical variables to aesthetic elements like colour.</p>
<p>To make our lives easier, we will work with factors through the <code>forcats</code> package loaded as part of the tidyverse.</p>

<h2>Your turn: learning to use factors</h2>
<p>We think the best way to learn the basics of factors is to work through Worksheet A5 (factors portion).</p>

<h2>In-class schedule</h2>

<h3>First part</h3>
<ul>
<li>Haven’t attempted all of the factors portion of Worksheet A5? Then spend this time attempting unattempted questions.</li>
<li>Finished attempting all of the questions? Then do the optional <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors">R4DS Factors</a> reading, and maybe even do some of the exercises for extra practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this time, teaching team will also walk around and answer questions and chat about anything factors related.</p>

<h2>NYC Flights Case Study</h2>
<p>We’ll show off how to use the <code>lubridate</code> package in the tidyverse to work with date variables in datasets in this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/notes/supp-a10-solution.Rmd">NYC Flights case study</a>.</p>
<p>For the sake of time, we’ll just go over the solutions together, instead of having you attempt exercises on your own first. We think this will be sufficient to get a hang of the basics of <code>lubridate</code>. That being said, want extra practice? Then check out the <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes">R4DS Dates and Times Chapter</a>!</p>
<!-- Let's say you want to convert a string into a date object.  -->
<!-- The `lubridate` package in the `tidyverse` has your back with a family of functions named as permutations of "y", "m", and "d".  -->
<!-- ```{r, message=FALSE}  -->
<!-- library(lubridate) -->
<!-- ymd("2020-10-06")  -->
<!-- mdy("October 6th, 2020") -->
<!-- dmy("06-10-2020") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We can also convert strings into date-time objects using `lubridate` functions. The family of functions you're looking for is named with a "y"/"m"/"d" permutation followed by an "_" and one or more of "h", "m", and "s".  -->
<!-- ```{r}  -->
<!-- ymd_hms("2020-10-06 14:20:39") -->
<!-- ymd_hm("2020-10-06 14:20") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Note that there are also time objects, though we don't cover them here.  -->
<!-- Once you've acquired a date or date/time object, you can use `lubridate` functions to extract individual components of the data or date/time.  -->
<!-- ```{r}  -->
<!-- today_date <- today() -->
<!-- year(today_date) -->
<!-- wday(today_date, label=TRUE) -->
<!-- yday(today_date) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### Date/Time Math  -->
<!-- An incredible advantage of working with date and date-time objects in R is that you can make R do pesky time arithmetic for you.  -->
<!-- ```{r}  -->
<!-- today_date <- today() -->
<!-- christmas_this_year <- mdy(paste("December 25", year(today_date))) -->
<!-- christmas_this_year - today_date -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If you want to make sure your difference comes out as seconds (or want to convert between different units) you can use `as.duration`:  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- as.duration(christmas_this_year - today_date) -->
<!-- ``` -->
