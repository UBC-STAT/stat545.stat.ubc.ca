## Mini Data Analysis Project

### Learning Objectives

1. Prepare or tidy data for analysis.
2. Apply data manipulation, visualization, and modelling concepts to answer research questions using data in R.
3. Report your findings in a clear, reproducible R markdown document.

### Instructions / Workflow

This project is to be completed independently.

+ Students can choose a dataset from the datateachr package
+ The mini-data analysis project is structured into 3 semi-guided deliverables meant to give the student enough freedom to answer their questions of interest about their data, while guiding the student to avoid feeling too lost in their (for many) first time data analysis! 
+ Deliverables will be submitted through Canvas by the appropriate deadline.

### Deadlines

+ Milestone 1 is due on **Friday, October 3**.
+ Milestone 2 is due on **Friday, October 10**.
+ Milestone 3 is due on **Friday, October 24**.

### Grading Scheme

+ Each milestone is worth 30 points. The number of points allocated to each section / exercise will be annotated within each deliverable. Sections requiring more challenging code will often be allocated more points than easier questions.

+ 10 points will be allocated to the reproducibility, cleanliness, and coherence of the analysis. While the three milestones will be submitted as independent deliverables, the analysis itself is a continuum - think of it as 3 chapters to a story. Each chapter, or in this case, portion of your analysis, should be easily followed through by someone unfamiliar with the content. [Here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/06-best-practices-R/) is a good resource for what constitutes "good code". Learning good coding practices early in your career will save you hassle later on!
