# Worksheets

Options for working on these worksheets:

-   Edit them with instances of jupyterlab or jupyter notebook that are installed on your own computer. (BEST)
-   Edit them with UBC Syzygy (pronounced sizz-ij-ee): <https://ubc.syzygy.ca/>
-   Edit them with Google Colab: <https://research.google.com/colaboratory/> (LEAST PREFERABLE)

*Submit the worksheets by uploading your .ipynb file to the corresponding canvas assignment slot*.

*To get full marks for each participation worksheet, you must successfully answer at least 50% of all autograded questions.*

# Projects

You will be working on various projects on GitHub repositories within a GitHub Organization setup for this course. Some general things you should know:

**How to followup with a project submission**

You'll be given feedback as an Issue in your project repository, sometimes before your grade is posted.

-   Make sure you're `Watch`ing your repository, so that you will be notified by email whenever a new Issue or comment is posted -- you can find this option in the upper-right hand corner of your repository page.
-   You can use the Issue thread to have a conversation about your assignment results.
-   If you would like to dispute your grade, this Issue thread is the place to do it, but please do so only within 1 week after the grade has been posted.
