<!-- ******WORKSHEET****** -->

## Worksheet 1A

**Finish By:** Friday, September 18 at 23:59 PST **(Not for grades -- no need to submit!)**

__[Download here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/release/worksheet_01a/worksheet_01a.ipynb)__ and open with jupyterlab.

For the first two weeks, we'll be working on this worksheet in class. This worksheet is intended to:

- Get you used to filling out the worksheets; and
- Get you up-to-speed with using R.

-----

<!-- ******TUESDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Tuesday's Class `r tues_class_num`: Class Cancelled

```{r tues-date}
cat(tues_date_pretty)
```

**Imagine Day: class cancelled**

Use today and tomorrow to prepare for the course:

+ Watch the [Intro to STAT 545 Video Series video](https://youtu.be/6REhJVsbbAM) (a version is also available on canvas for those who cannot access YouTube).
+ Install the software needed for STAT 545A by following along the tutorial ["Software Installation for STAT 545"](/software-stack).

Note: each class will require some preparation. Take a look at the "Prepare for Class" section for Thursday's class!

<!-- ******THURSDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Thursday's Class `r thurs_class_num`: Intro to R and STAT 545

```{r thurs-date}
cat(thurs_date_pretty)
```

Today, we'll be learning the basics of R:

#### Prepare for Class

Have you completed the exercises in "Class 00A"? Do that first before starting! In addition:

- Watch the [STAT 545 Video Series: Episode 1-A: Coding your Analysis for Success](https://youtu.be/91LmBj29-Sc) (also available on canvas)
- Familiarize yourself with Zoom: read the [Getting Started with Zoom](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/tutorials/zoom/) guide found in the "Tutorials" section of the course website. 

Some useful (but not mandatory) readings are:

- [Intro to R](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html)
- [Why R?](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/what-is-r/)

#### During Class

1. We'll start with a demo of R via Zoom.
2. We'll jump into the worksheet (see above) during the last 45 minutes. 

We may alternate the two if it feels right.

Nothing to submit this week! Woohoo!
