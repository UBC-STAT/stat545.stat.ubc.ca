<p><strong>Total Points</strong>: 100</p>
<p>In Assignment B-1, you practiced writing a function. This time, we’ll be evaluating your ability to wrap that function (or something else!) in an R package.</p>
<p>Need some help? Checkout <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html">chapter 2</a> of the “R packages” book.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For Assignment B-4, you will have the option to expand on your R package and develop it further (amongst other options).</p>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Go to canvas to get your invitation to create a GitHub repository for this project. You can find this in the description of Assignment B-2. Name your repo as you wish, so long as it’s informative.</p>

<div id="tidy-submission-20-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidy Submission (20 points)</h2>
<p>Follow these steps once you’re ready to submit your work.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Increase the version number in the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file, using <a href="https://semver.org">semantic versioning conventions</a>. You should not have a trailing <code>.9000</code>.
<ul>
<li>Summary of convention: <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, where initial development starts at <code>0.1.0</code>, and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release
<ul>
<li>Only release <code>1.0.0</code> if your package is being used in production and ready for public use.</li>
<li>e.g. <code>0.1.0</code> :arrow_right: <code>0.1.1</code> :arrow_right: <code>0.1.X</code> :arrow_right: <code>1.0.0</code> :arrow_right: <code>1.0.1</code> :arrow_right: <code>1.0.X</code> :arrow_right: <code>1.1.0</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your release versioning is especially important if you will be choosing to develop your package further.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tag a release in your GitHub repository corresponding to your submission before the deadline, using the package version as your tag.</li>
<li>Grab the URL corresponding to your tagged release, and submit that to canvas. Make sure the TAs and Lucy can see your repository! Either it should be public or private with TAs and Lucy added as collaborators.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tidy submission rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>The above steps were followed.</li>
<li>Your work must be reproducible from beginning to end, error-free.</li>
<li>Your work is self-contained in a GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Code should adopt a consistent and easy-to-read style – ideally, the <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse style</a>, although we’re certainly not looking for strict adherence.</li>
<li>You use proper English, spelling, and grammar, and write concisely. If there’s any uncertainty in determining a grade here, the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md">UBC MDS writing rubric</a> will be referred to.</li>
<li>If there’s any further uncertainty in determining a grade for this tidy submission portion, the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_mech.md">UBC MDS mechanics rubric</a> will be referred to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific to this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra emphasis is placed on English, spelling, and grammar, because package documentation is a big part of producing an R package.</li>
<li>All files necessary for a tidy R package are present, in working form, and up-to-date. This includes, at a minimum:
<ul>
<li>NAMESPACE</li>
<li>DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>README.Rmd (and README.md)</li>
<li>R/ directory</li>
<li>tests/ directory</li>
<li>man/ directory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your package can be installed using <code>devtools::install_github(...)</code>, or at least, from source, without a fuss.</li>
<li>After clicking <code>Check</code> on your package, there are no “warnings” and no “errors” (errors are worse). “Notes” are allowed, although you should try to get rid of them, too.</li>
<li>Your R package works, is effectively designed, and has orderly components.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exercise-1-functions-20-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 1: Function(s) (20 points)</h2>
<p>Render the documentation for all of the functions / objects in your package. You should include documentation as requested in Assignment B-1 (title, description, parameter description, and output description), but also (1) include examples under the <code>@examples</code> tag, and (2) be sure to include the <code>@export</code> tag to make functions available to users (unless you want the function to be strictly internal)</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: if you’re using the same function as in Assignment B-1, you should only need to put your function in an R script in the <code>R/</code> folder with the specified additions to your roxygen2 documentation. Then, run <code>document()</code> after loading the devtools package.</p>
<p><strong>What we’re looking for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You followed the above instructions.</li>
<li>You should have <code>.Rd</code> files automatically generated in your <code>man/</code> folder. Don’t touch these files.</li>
<li>Functions intended to be used by a package user are deliberately listed under “exports” in the NAMESPACE file (this should happen automatically after running <code>document()</code> and having <code>@export</code> tags with your functions).</li>
<li>Documentation for each function should load after executing <code>?function</code> after loading your package.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exercise-2-high-level-documentation-20-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 2: High-level documentation (20 points)</h2>
<p>Create documentation for your R package at a high level.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fill out a <code>README.Rmd</code> file, being sure to include the package description, installation instructions, and demonstrated usage. Knit to <code>README.md</code> using <code>devtools::build_readme()</code>, and don’t ever touch the <code>README.md</code> file.</li>
<li>In the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file, update the package title and description fields (you can use the same description as you did in your README).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hints</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When writing your description, imagine coming across the package on CRAN, and evaluating whether the package is relevant to you based solely on this description. It should be concise and informative.</li>
<li>Use the README boilerplate that comes with running <code>usethis::use_readme_rmd()</code>.</li>
<li>Installation instructions: should be as simple as running, for example, <code>install_github("org/repo", build_vignettes = TRUE, ref = "0.1.0")</code> (don’t include <code>build_vignettes</code> if you have no vignettes; change the version number to your own).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we’re looking for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The above instructions were followed.</li>
<li>The documentation is clear, simple, and effective.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exercise-3-description-file-20-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 3: DESCRIPTION file (20 points)</h2>
<p>Aside from the description field in the DESCRIPTION file, ensure everything else in the DESCRIPTION file (and its related parts) are in place.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ensure a license is in place, and found in the DESCRIPTION file. We suggest <code>usethis::use_mit_license()</code> as an open-source-friendly license.</li>
<li>Ensure package dependencies are listed in the DESCRIPTION file, and are effectively chosen (probably listed under “Imports”). Packages that come pre-loaded upon opening R are candidates to be listed here, too, such as the datasets and stats packages (but not the base package).</li>
<li>Ensure all calls to functions from external packages are called using the form <code>package::function()</code> (only in very rare situations will you not need to use <code>::</code>).</li>
<li>Ensure all other mechanical structure of the DESCRIPTION file is in place, i.e., passes a <code>Check</code>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="exercise-4-tests-20-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 4: Tests (20 points)</h2>
<p>Properly install unit tests in your package.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: if you’re using the same function as in Assignment B-1, you should only need to copy and paste your <code>test_that</code> calls after creating a test file using <code>usethis::use_test(...)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>What we’re looking for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extent of testing should match that of Assignment B-1. So, you may not need to add any more tests if your tests were sufficient, but this is an important note if you plan on adding more functions / objects to your R package.</li>
<li>Your tests should all pass after running <code>devtools::test()</code>.</li>
<li>You should use testthat for writing unit tests, and nothing else.</li>
<li>If you create an object in a test script, you clean up after yourself using <code>rm('name_of_object')</code> (not needed if the objects are created <em>within</em> a <code>test_that()</code> function.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
