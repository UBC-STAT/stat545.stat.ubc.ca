title: "STAT 545A Assignment 01: Tools for data analytic work"
---

__Due September 17, 2019 at 23:59__

## Objective

This assignment was designed to give you practice with the tools discussed in the first two weeks: GitHub, R, (R) Markdown, and git. You'll be:

- Developing of a simple repository with GitHub; perhaps git too
- Authoring in GitHub-flavoured markdown and R markdown
- Coding in R through data exploration
- Generating output from (`.Rmd`) source

using RStudio.

As you work on the assignment, you are welcome to work from the browser (i.e., directly on GitHub), but we encourage you to pilot a more powerful workflow:

- Pull from GitHub (just an empty precaution now, but will matter when you collaborate with others).
- Make changes locally to local files -- RStudio is a great Markdown editor! Click Preview to see how it's going to look!
- Save your changes.
- Commit your changes to your repo.
- Push the commit to GitHub.

## Tidy Submission (20%)

Follow the instructions for making a tidy submission, found on the [assignments home page](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/assignments).

Note: Usually, a tidy submission does not have this much weight, but we recognize that this part is not trivial for your first time. A tidy submission involves using the tools taught in Weeks 1 and 2, and this is what this assignment is all about.

## Writing (5%)

- You must use proper English, spelling, and grammar.
- Your writing is concise. 

If there's any further uncertainty in determining a grade here, the [UBC MDS writing rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md) will be used.

## Exercise 1: Edit `README.md` (30%)

---

Rubrics: 

- [accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md): (10%)
	- Does your markdown render properly, or are there mistakes like _this__ or (this)[www.example.com]?
- completeness: (20%)
	- Did you include at least five markdown features in your README? (= 4% each)

---

Your task here is to edit the main `README.md` file in your repository. It should contain the following:

1. The beginning of the README should contain a very brief description as to what the repository is (a sentence or two), so that an unknowing visitor landing on the repository can orient themselves. You should also help the visitor navigate your repository (in whatever way you think is most appropriate). 
2. Then, introduce yourself briefly. 

When writing your README, be sure to showcase at least five functionalities of GitHub-flavoured markdown. The [markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) might help here, or, the *Help* menu in RStudio will bring up a Markdown Quick Reference at any time.

Here's a [sample readme file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-home/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw01/sample_readme.md) that goes way above and beyond what we're looking for (aside from describing the repo).

## Exercise 2: R Markdown for Gapminder exploration (30%)

---

Rubrics:

- [accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md): (20%)
	- Did you use at least three functions?
	- Given that you did, does your code run error-free?
- [reasoning](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_reasoning.md): (10%)
	- Does your exploration showcase the dataset?

---

Make an R Markdown document that explores a dataset, such as gapminder seen in class. You don't need an extensive exploration in order to get a good grade here, you just need enough to show a reader the dataset without actually printing it to screen. You should demonstrate the use of at least three functions.

Don't forget! Your "tidy submission" marks relies on you rendering your R Markdown file to the `github_document` output format. Commit both the `.Rmd` and `.md` files and push them to GitHub. Give this a decent name, such as `hw01_gapminder.Rmd` (which will produce a companion file, `hw01_gapminder.md`). These files should also be in a folder called something like `hw01`.

## Exercise 3: R Markdown presentation slides (15%)

---

Rubrics:

- [accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md): (5%)
	- Did you manage to produce slides at all?
- [reasoning](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_reasoning.md): (10%)
	- Is your slide deck formatted so that it actually looks like it could be a presentation? We _are not referring to_ whether your slides would make an _effective_ presentation (by, for example, minimizing your text and keeping your slides simple). By "formatted", we mean things like:
		- Slides do not have text overflowing its boundaries
		- Sentences are not cut in half by a new slide.
		- At least some slides have titles.

---

Produce slides out of your Gapminder exploration using R Markdown -- for example, using the `ioslides` or `xaringan` output. Don't worry, you won't be presenting these -- the objective of this exercise is to see that you can make slides. Feel free to make a new `.Rmd` file for this.
